                    <dd>During my first 2 years at univerity it was difficult for me to join any extra-curricular activities due to covid, there weren't many opportunities during this time. When I was finally at compus I decied to invest all my time into networking events. The link upon is the next event which I will be attending, I feel that for myself this form of extra-curricular activities works best as it is directly aligned with my future goals. </dd>
